## Start Citrus GUI
```{r citrus-ui, warning = FALSE, messages = FALSE, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
require(citrus)
citrus.launchUI()
```

## GUI

## Generated script
```{r citrus-script-1, warning = FALSE, messages = FALSE, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Use this line to limit the number of 
# threads used by clustering
# Rclusterpp.setThreads(1);
options("mc.cores"=1);

# Wnat analysis to perform?
family = "classification"

# Set data and output directories
dataDirectory = 
  "C:/R/win-library/3.4/citrus/extdata/example1"
outputDirectory = file.path(dataDirectory,"citrusOutput")
```

## Generated script
```{r citrus-script-2, warning = FALSE, messages = FALSE, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Specify columns to use
clusteringColumns = c("Red","Blue")
medianColumns=c()

transformColumns = c()
transformCofactor = 5

scaleColumns = c()
```

## Generated script
```{r citrus-script-3, warning = FALSE, messages = FALSE, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Specify parameters

fileSampleSize = 1000
